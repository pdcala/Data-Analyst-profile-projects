# Data-Analyst-profile-projects
This folder includes my projects as a data analyst. This folder only contains the final analysis reports. 

Here is the list of the projects with the executive summary:

1. How has AI development influenced the job market for recent graduates? (See "Job postings report YJ 10.2025")
This reports analyses employment trends in the context of rapid AI development to understand patterns of job postings, career progression in terms of salaries and required skills for data-related roles.

The analysis found that AI development has increased the demand for jobs in data infrastructure, data analysis, data science and data management and security. Other entry-level jobs are also directly disrupted by AI, or require augmentation and skill shift. For better career progression, AI-resistant skills such as communication, problem-solving, analytical thinking, and adaptability are high valued by employers.

For students who want to enter a data-related career, they should develop proficiencies in mostly used programming languages, cloud platforms, and databases.
